The vegetable manchurian recipe involves two step process.Making veg balls and making machurian gravy 
use food processor to pulse and finely grate all the vegetables. Mix the veggies with poha or ( bread crumbs) and rice flour along with all the seasoning. Create a dough like mixture. Make smooth rounded small balls. I use cookie dough scoop so it measures evenly. 
Using the appe-pan or air-fryer cook the veggie balls to golden brown. Set them aside.
Make the Manchurian Gravy by saut√©ing all the veggies and aromatics in oil. Add the rice flour slurry to the mix so the gravy thickens. 
Add the prepared veggie balls in the gravy. Adjust the seasoning. Garnish with green onions and serve hot.
